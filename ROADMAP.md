# Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for Highcharts Controls.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Guess control type from the value or evaluated path. Fall back to `text`.
- [ ] Numbers with units. When for example `16px` or `50%` is given as value for
  a number control, it should be handled under the hood.
- [ ] Support for Dashboards
- [ ] Wider Current Options view, don't limit to the width of the controls.
- [ ] Smart rendering of `select` control: buttons for 2-3 options, dropdown for 4+ options
