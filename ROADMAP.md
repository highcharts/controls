# Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for Highcharts Controls.

## Planned Features

- Consider the JS API. Does it make sense that the `controls` option includes
  groups and nested controls? Should it be `items`?
- Light and dark mode support for color inputs?
- Extendible architecture, opening up for registering custom control types
- Separators. Useful for many controls with related functionality, but in the
  same group

**Note:** This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and project priorities. Dates are estimates and may shift as development progresses.
