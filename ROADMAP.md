# Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for Highcharts Controls.

## Planned Features

- Wider Current Options view, don't limit to the width of the controls.
- A `label` attribute for the control items, to override what is rendered in
  the `<label>` tag.
- Smart rendering of `select` control: buttons for 2-3 options, dropdown for 4+
  options
- Consider the JS API. Does it make sense that the `controls` option includes
  groups and nested controls?
- npm package.
