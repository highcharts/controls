# Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for Highcharts Controls.

## Planned Features

- [ ] More compact view with one or two controls, which is probably the most
  common use case.
- [ ] Wider Current Options view, don't limit to the width of the controls.
- [ ] A `label` attribute for the control items, to override what is rendered in
  the `<label>` tag.
- [ ] Smart rendering of `select` control: buttons for 2-3 options, dropdown for 4+ options
